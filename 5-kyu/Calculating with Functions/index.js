  Title:
    Calculating with Functions

  Description:
    This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results.

    There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
    There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations:
    plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby)

    Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
    The most outer function represents the left operand,
    the most inner function represents the right operand

  Examples:
    seven(times(five())); // must return 35
    four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
    eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
    six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3
